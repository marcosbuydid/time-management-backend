# REST API
I made this repository focused on making a REST API for the Time-Management Web App
using: Node, Express and Mongo.

## Initialization
Create a free account on mongodb website https://www.mongodb.com/ 

Create a free cluster and inside of it a new database. 

Use MongoDB Compass to connect to the cluster.

After download master branch, remember to install node modules inside the proyect.

#### Create a .env file inside proyect folder and write:

PORT=4000

DB_CNN="replace by your cluster url path and the db connection route"

PK="replace by your private key used to sign your JSON token"
___

Initialize the proyect using npm run dev.
